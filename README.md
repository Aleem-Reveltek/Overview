# Welcome to United Home

Every home we work on will have:
* Pinterest Board
* Youtube Playlist
* GitHub Repo

Inside the GitHub Repo, we will give links to the Youtube Channel & the Pinterest Board in the Readme file.

We will also encourage others to contribute and provide open-source tasks for our Open Source BIM Approach.

BIM or Building Information Modeling is a highly collaborative process allowing architects, engineers, contractors, and other industry professionals to design, document, visualize, and construct buildings ideally from a single digital model.
